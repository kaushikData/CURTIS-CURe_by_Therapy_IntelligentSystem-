That means that he does have some control. People with genuine anger issues usually don’t. But he is controlling his feelings rather than dealing with them.A therapist only has what the client presents to work with. My guess is that the therapist was correct in assessing your boyfriend as not having issues with anger. What the therapist didn’t understand was how anxious your boyfriend gets when things don’t go his way.If your boyfriend will accept your help, you could go with him to a therapy appointment and explain what you see. Your boyfriend could use some help learning new and more effective ways to cope with mistakes, with unexpected disappointments, and with a buildup of pressures.

However, I disagree. He gets incredibly angry over the smallest thing, like a paper falling on the floor, or traffic congestion, or if he forgets where he put something, etc. One time he thought he forgot that he left a tool outside when we left his house, and he slammed on the brakes so hard that my forehead almost went through the front windsheld!

We moved around the corner from his mum but the last 6 months it appears she has tried to manipulatively break us up. I’ll give you some examples. She came into our home and placed photos of him as a child on our fridge and around the house. We only ever socialise with her, friends her age, and while we are at those occasions she superficially talks up her son’s talents, and looks, and how special he is. My partner lovingly tries to talk about things me or my family are also doing, and every single time she changes the subject, or worse, talks about someone she distantly knows that did the same thing or better. My partner tries to enable me to be proud of myself and my family too, but it’s always to no avail. She has completely shattered my confidence, that I don’t speak much anymore. We’ve been trying for a baby for over a year and she told me when she found out that he can’t afford to have a child because he needs her permission because he owes her money (he doesn’t owe her much). She then tried to convince me to break up with him and go out with my best friend. They have told me for some time the family does not celebrate birthdays, but recently for my partner’s 45th all her friends starting saying his mum was organising a dinner. He said my mother won’t decide for me who I spend my birthday with. I want to spend my day with you.. Next thing, a motorcyclist had bumped the side of her car, no one was injured but he said his mum was in a catatonic state. He then told her she could organise her dinner because she wanted to. We got there, and she had pulled out of her catatonic state pretty brilliantly, with balloons you’d see at 12 year olds party and her two closest friends. I couldn’t get a word in much at this dinner, but one of her friends said she was looking for a husband, and his mum said, darling you should marry her. It’s all caused me so much pain.

The fact that you continue to experience symptoms indicates that if you are receiving treatment, it’s not working. You also mentioned suicide but don’t have a specific plan to end your life. Any thoughts of suicide, even in the absence of a plan, are concerning. Your family is concerned about you and rightly so. By your own admission, you are not well.It’s imperative that you seek mental health treatment. Ask your mother if she would be willing to have you evaluated. A mental health professional could determine what may be wrong but more important, develop an appropriate treatment plan to deal with your symptoms.You may also consider family therapy, a type of therapy that includes your family in treatment. You mentioned that your mother is an “inconsistent parent” and is contributing to your unhappiness. Family therapy could address that problem directly. You can suggest this type of therapy to your mother and or the mental health evaluator, who could advise you about how to access family therapy.In the meantime, try to improve your self-care. Not eating, depriving your body of the nutrients it needs to function properly, is likely contributing to your emotional instability. Your body needs food to survive and without it you will not feel well physically or psychologically.You also mentioned that you don’t “treat yourself very well.” You’re using illegal drugs and alcohol and engaging in self-harm. The use of drugs and alcohol can also significantly increase your distressing symptoms. Alcohol is a nervous system depressant and can intensify your depression. Drugs and alcohol alter one’s mood. The initial ingestion of drugs or alcohol may seem to improve your mood but it does not last. Drugs and alcohol alter your brain chemistry and ultimately complicate mood disorders. Avoid all drugs and alcohol.Finally, self-harm is a form of self-destruction. When people engage in self-harm, it usually means that they lack important problem-solving skills. The most efficient way to learn these important life skills is through the assistance of a mental health professional.I hope you will take my advice. Speak to your mother about seeing a mental health professional and do what is necessary to receive treatment as soon as possible. Don’t ignore your suicidal thoughts and go to the hospital if you feel you might be a danger to yourself or someone else. Please take care.</td>\n",

Individuals who are experiencing a dissociative fugue might be confused about who they are and even create a new identity.

Sleep deprivation can also mimic certain dissociative conditions.Your doctor may also refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist who can diagnose and treat mental health conditions.

It is not uncommon for individuals to have both DID and PTSD. In fact, some studies have shown that among individuals diagnosed with DID, the majority have a secondary diagnosis of PTSD.According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) for mental health disorders the diagnostic criteria for a DID diagnosis includes:(1) the presence of two or more identities; (2) at least two of these identities recurrently take control of the person’s behavior; and (3) having an inability to recall personal information. Your specific symptoms include having no memory of your childhood; a history of severe abuse; a recognition of other possible personalities (often referred to as identity alteration); and time loss experiences. Generally speaking, your symptoms are in line with a DID diagnosis.I would strongly encourage you to be evaluated by someone who has experience treating dissociative disorders or trauma. One of the main difficulties with DID, and dissociative disorders in general, is that individuals may be experiencing symptoms they are not fully aware of. This is why it is important to seek outside assistance from trained mental health professionals. It would also be beneficial to educate yourself about DID. A quick Amazon.com or Barnes &amp; Noble search could help you to identify helpful resources.While I cannot offer a reliable diagnosis over the Internet, I do believe that dissociative disorder is a possibility. A psychiatric evaluation is the quickest strategy for determining an accurate diagnosis and more importantly to guide you to effective treatments. I wish you the best of luck.

We don’t forget what’s going on when one of the others is controlling the body. For instance, when I feel threatened or insulted a stronger person will stand in.

This is the diagnosis for someone who feels negative about one physical attribute despite the fact that most people wouldn’t think it matters. We live in a culture that values tall, dark and handsome, it’s true. But it’s also true that some of the sexiest men alive are under 5’7″. Tom Cruise, Prince, and Bruno Mars, Henry Winkler, Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino are all on the list. (For a longer list, see: here.) People admire them for their personalities and their accomplishments and aren’t concerned about their height.Self-esteem isn’t based on height or any other physical characteristic. It’s based on two things: how you feel about yourself and how you treat other people. The two parts are in interaction with each other. The more good you do for others, the better you will feel about yourself. The better you feel about yourself, the more you will be willing to take risks in enriching your relationships with others.For that reason, I suggest you focus on what you can contribute to make the world a better place. At first, it will be hard to stop your negative thoughts about your height. But as you get involved in helping others and get closer to people as a result, the less your physical stature will matter.If you still are obsessed with your height despite making good films and doing more for others, then it may be time for a little therapy. A counselor can help you learn techniques for stopping the negative thoughts and for focusing on all that is going well in your life.I wish you well.</td>\n",

My heart goes out to you.You mentioned that you were sexually abused twice in your life. The abuse that you suffered very likely has a lot to do with how you’re feeling. It also likely explains why you have difficulty trusting others. You were hurt and understandably you do not want it to happen again. Relationships are difficult. You don’t want anyone to get too close. You are guarded. In an effort to essentially hurt yourself before someone else does, you purposefully harm yourself.

With your emotional problems, it’s not fair to judge how suitable college is for you. You went to college because that is what your family wanted.

       "      <td>My 10-year-old son has been repeatedly stealing. My husband and I have spoken about this with him several times. He always promises us that he will never ever do it again and that he has realised his mistake , but a couple weeks later he brings home something that is not his. He has so far been caught at a grocery store where he was forgiven, stole from me at home to buy few books. All our efforts have been futile. Today he bought home a couple of toys that he stole from his friends. We would like to take him to his teacher tomorrow and make him return the items, but fear that he will be socially scarred for life and worse, he may stoop in to do worse things for us exposing him to his freinds .. Please help. We are desperate parents and only want best for our child.</td>\n",

       "3704   I appreciate you allowing me to respond to your questions. The short answer is to not just visit, but to make a series of appointments with the therapist. While there are many possibilities for these, thoughts the chronic use of marijuana and the absorbing conspiracy theories seem like they were fertile ground for the paranoid tendencies.The fact that your own sensibilities recognize this pattern of thought and that you are able to articulate it is a good thing, as is the fact you see your reactions as being illogical or undesirable. It means you are able to monitor these elements and see that they are in need of change.I would capitalize on this awareness and put it into action by seeing a therapist. The “Find Help” tab at the top of the page should help you locate someone in your area.Wishing you patience and peace,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "4474   I’m sorry to have to tell you that you didn’t have a great relationship. You had a secret relationship with a married man. Different nationalities, religions, and ages can be bridged. But cheating cannot. He’s being unfair and dishonest with his wife every time he calls you or spends time with you. On your side, you’ve convinced yourself that having so little is a “great” relationship.My guess is that having a heart attack made him question whether he is making the right decisions in his life. Being confronted with mortality has a way of doing that. It’s also possible that his wife found out what was going on while he was in the hospital and demanded that he make some more honorable choices. He is communicating with you. Deleting you from his Blackberry is deleting your from his life. Further, he is being as dishonorable with you as he was with his wife. He isn’t talking about the things that need to be talked about.My best advice to you is to move on — even if he does call you. He’s not serious about making a life with you. You’ve already wasted three years of love and time on this guy. It’s more than enough. Grieve the relationship and move on.I wish you well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "4783   It sounds to me like your boyfriend either has a very low tolerance for frustration or he lets frustration build up to the point that the slightest little thing makes it all spill out at once. He doesn’t have anger issues so much as insufficient coping skills. To his credit, he doesn’t take his frustration out on the people around him, only at objects. That means that he does have some control. People with genuine anger issues usually don’t. But he is controlling his feelings rather than dealing with them.A therapist only has what the client presents to work with. My guess is that the therapist was correct in assessing your boyfriend as not having issues with anger. What the therapist didn’t understand was how anxious your boyfriend gets when things don’t go his way.If your boyfriend will accept your help, you could go with him to a therapy appointment and explain what you see. Your boyfriend could use some help learning new and more effective ways to cope with mistakes, with unexpected disappointments, and with a buildup of pressures. Life without adequate coping skills is hard on the person and hard on the people around him. You both deserve better.I wish you both well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "984    This has nothing to do with Asperger’s. You partner has to step up and confront his mother about her shenanigans. This is simply an immature manipulative effort on his mother’s part. It isn’t worth your time or effort to continuing a relationship with someone that doesn’t accept you. He needs to explain to her exactly what she is doing and how destructive it is. Once this is done –confront her every time she does something that undermines you, and both of you praise her and validate her when she does something supportive. If she doesn’t respond in a reasonable amount of time I’d begin severely limiting time and contact with her.Wishing you patience and peace,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4101   You stated that you been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety but have you received treatment? The fact that you continue to experience symptoms indicates that if you are receiving treatment, it’s not working. You also mentioned suicide but don’t have a specific plan to end your life. Any thoughts of suicide, even in the absence of a plan, are concerning. Your family is concerned about you and rightly so. By your own admission, you are not well.It’s imperative that you seek mental health treatment. Ask your mother if she would be willing to have you evaluated. A mental health professional could determine what may be wrong but more important, develop an appropriate treatment plan to deal with your symptoms.You may also consider family therapy, a type of therapy that includes your family in treatment. You mentioned that your mother is an “inconsistent parent” and is contributing to your unhappiness. Family therapy could address that problem directly. You can suggest this type of therapy to your mother and or the mental health evaluator, who could advise you about how to access family therapy.In the meantime, try to improve your self-care. Not eating, depriving your body of the nutrients it needs to function properly, is likely contributing to your emotional instability. Your body needs food to survive and without it you will not feel well physically or psychologically.You also mentioned that you don’t “treat yourself very well.” You’re using illegal drugs and alcohol and engaging in self-harm. The use of drugs and alcohol can also significantly increase your distressing symptoms. Alcohol is a nervous system depressant and can intensify your depression. Drugs and alcohol alter one’s mood. The initial ingestion of drugs or alcohol may seem to improve your mood but it does not last. Drugs and alcohol alter your brain chemistry and ultimately complicate mood disorders. Avoid all drugs and alcohol.Finally, self-harm is a form of self-destruction. When people engage in self-harm, it usually means that they lack important problem-solving skills. The most efficient way to learn these important life skills is through the assistance of a mental health professional.I hope you will take my advice. Speak to your mother about seeing a mental health professional and do what is necessary to receive treatment as soon as possible. Don’t ignore your suicidal thoughts and go to the hospital if you feel you might be a danger to yourself or someone else. Please take care.   \n",
       "4020   You have described an unusual incident. What you may have experienced is a dissociative fugue. A dissociative fugue involves temporarily losing one’s sense of identity. Individuals who are experiencing a dissociative fugue might be confused about who they are and even create a new identity. Individuals who experience dissociative episodes are often under extreme duress or have experienced or witnessed extreme trauma.Symptoms of dissociative fugue include sudden or unplanned travel away from home or work, the inability to recall past events or important information about oneself, experiencing confusion about self-identity or gaps in memory, and extreme distress and problems with daily functioning.In cases where a dissociative fugue is suspected, it’s important to rule out physical conditions such as epilepsy or head injuries. Sleep deprivation can also mimic certain dissociative conditions.Your doctor may also refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist who can diagnose and treat mental health conditions. Mental health treatment would likely focus on the stress or trauma that triggered the dissociative episode.In the meantime, try to keep track of these usual experiences. Ask your husband to assist you. Document any unusual behavior before and during an incident. That information would be helpful in understanding what may be wrong.

       "2117   I don’t have enough information to comment on whether your husband is “over-attached.” He may simply be “attached,” which is a good thing. A man who is loving and loyal to his family is usually a man who knows how to be loving and loyal to his wife. If his family was asking him to choose them over you, it would be another story. I don’t see that in your letter. Instead, I see a family that misses him and that tries to pack 12 months of contact into 1 month.You didn’t mention how old his sister is. If she is over 21 and inappropriately hugging, it might be advisable for your husband to start asserting some boundaries. That’s a “might.” Since I can’t witness what goes on, I can’t venture a definite. If she has a boyfriend or is dating, it’s probably not a problem but if her only affectionate contact with a male is your husband, it may not be helpful for him to go along with all of it.If you were seeing me as a couple, I’d be asking your husband what he can do to reassure you that he hasn’t “forgotten” you during his family visits. And I’d be advising you to make more effort to befriend the sister by taking her on some “girls’ only” lunches or shopping trips or events. You’ll learn more about her when she isn’t so focused on her brother. It would be helpful if your husband supported you by encouraging his sister to go with you.I wish you well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "5155   From such a short letter it is difficult to determine if PTSD is the correct diagnosis. It very well may be but dissociative identity disorder (DID) is also a realistic possibility. It is not uncommon for individuals to have both DID and PTSD. In fact, some studies have shown that among individuals diagnosed with DID, the majority have a secondary diagnosis of PTSD.According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) for mental health disorders the diagnostic criteria for a DID diagnosis includes:(1) the presence of two or more identities; (2) at least two of these identities recurrently take control of the person’s behavior; and (3) having an inability to recall personal information. Your specific symptoms include having no memory of your childhood; a history of severe abuse; a recognition of other possible personalities (often referred to as identity alteration); and time loss experiences. Generally speaking, your symptoms are in line with a DID diagnosis.I would strongly encourage you to be evaluated by someone who has experience treating dissociative disorders or trauma. One of the main difficulties with DID, and dissociative disorders in general, is that individuals may be experiencing symptoms they are not fully aware of. This is why it is important to seek outside assistance from trained mental health professionals. It would also be beneficial to educate yourself about DID. A quick Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble search could help you to identify helpful resources.While I cannot offer a reliable diagnosis over the Internet, I do believe that dissociative disorder is a possibility. A psychiatric evaluation is the quickest strategy for determining an accurate diagnosis and more importantly to guide you to effective treatments. I wish you the best of luck.

       "3994   What you are describing is consistent with body dysmorphic disorder. This is the diagnosis for someone who feels negative about one physical attribute despite the fact that most people wouldn’t think it matters. We live in a culture that values tall, dark and handsome, it’s true. But it’s also true that some of the sexiest men alive are under 5’7″. Tom Cruise, Prince, and Bruno Mars, Henry Winkler, Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino are all on the list. (For a longer list, see: here.) People admire them for their personalities and their accomplishments and aren’t concerned about their height.Self-esteem isn’t based on height or any other physical characteristic. It’s based on two things: how you feel about yourself and how you treat other people. The two parts are in interaction with each other. The more good you do for others, the better you will feel about yourself. The better you feel about yourself, the more you will be willing to take risks in enriching your relationships with others.For that reason, I suggest you focus on what you can contribute to make the world a better place. At first, it will be hard to stop your negative thoughts about your height. But as you get involved in helping others and get closer to people as a result, the less your physical stature will matter.If you still are obsessed with your height despite making good films and doing more for others, then it may be time for a little therapy. A counselor can help you learn techniques for stopping the negative thoughts and for focusing on all that is going well in your life.I wish you well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "573    It is clear that you are suffering deeply. I’m sorry that you’re having such a difficult time living. My heart goes out to you.You mentioned that you were sexually abused twice in your life. The abuse that you suffered very likely has a lot to do with how you’re feeling. It also likely explains why you have difficulty trusting others. You were hurt and understandably you do not want it to happen again. Relationships are difficult. You don’t want anyone to get too close. You are guarded. In an effort to essentially hurt yourself before someone else does, you purposefully harm yourself. It may also be your way of gaining control. What you may be experiencing, at least in part, is post-traumatic stress. Post-traumatic stress is a common response to trauma. People who have experienced traumatic experiences may feel emotionally numb. Some describe this numbness as being almost detached from life.With regard to college, maybe it wasn’t for you or maybe it was. With your emotional problems, it’s not fair to judge how suitable college is for you. You went to college because that is what your family wanted. You view that as something negative but try to think about it from a different perspective. You are learning about what makes you happy; you are experiencing life. Maybe you are meant to be an artist, a musician, a gourmet chef or a college professor. It is the wrong point in your life to come to conclusions about your future career.You wrote that you essentially do not know how to continue with living. I would concur with this statement. You need guidance. Everyone in life needs guidance. You need the help of a wise, competent and knowledgeable therapist who can help you overcome this unpleasant time in your life. You mentioned depression, experiencing passive suicidal ideation, and having panic attacks. What you didn’t mention is whether or not you’ve ever tried counseling. You could greatly benefit from counseling. If you have not tried it, then you have not given yourself an opportunity to improve your life. Life has ups and downs. Your life may be unpleasant now but do not believe that it will always stay that way.I hope you will consider therapy. Please click on the find help tab to find a therapist in your community.

       "3704  It all started after high school. I smoked a lot of marijuana, watched a lot of conspiracy, and was practically a shut in. I started to suspect there was conspiracy in my own life, things that people thought about me that I didn’t know.

       "4474  My boyfriend is suddenly not communicating with me. I have been working in Saudi for almost 6 years and I have a boyfriend for 3 years. He is is married with no kids. He is 40 years old and I’m close to 30. We are from different countries and diferent religions. We have a great relationship but his family doesn’t know about our relationship except his best friend. 11 days ago, we had a good time with each other. Before he went on a trip he called me and he told me he loves me so much and after that he did not call me. I found out he had heart attack and he was admitted in the hospital where I am working. I could not visit him because his family. He closed his mobile and after he discharged, he opened his mobile but still, he did not call me and informed me what happened. He deleted me in his blackberry messenger and never replied to my messages at all. Does it mean he already ended his relationship with me without closure?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "4783   My boyfriend of just over a year, who is 33 years old, may have anger issues. I thought he had an issue even before he told me that his ex-girlfriend thought he had an anger issue and should see a therapist (which he did). The therapist told him his anger levels are normal. However, I disagree. He gets incredibly angry over the smallest thing, like a paper falling on the floor, or traffic congestion, or if he forgets where he put something, etc. One time he thought he forgot that he left a tool outside when we left his house, and he slammed on the brakes so hard that my forehead almost went through the front windsheld! He also punched the steering wheel in the car one time because he had the hiccups. I find that his actions in most cases are at a much higher degree of anger than the average person, but I would like to get a professional opinion. I would very much appreciate hearing your thoughts on this. Thank you! *Note: He’s never once directed his anger at me, only at inanimate objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "984   I have been in a relationship with a man in his mid-40’s for over a year, and as a couple without outside influences we have a supportive, loving and kind relationship, and rarely a disagreement. We moved around the corner from his mum but the last 6 months it appears she has tried to manipulatively break us up. I’ll give you some examples. She came into our home and placed photos of him as a child on our fridge and around the house. We only ever socialise with her, friends her age, and while we are at those occasions she superficially talks up her son’s talents, and looks, and how special he is. My partner lovingly tries to talk about things me or my family are also doing, and every single time she changes the subject, or worse, talks about someone she distantly knows that did the same thing or better. My partner tries to enable me to be proud of myself and my family too, but it’s always to no avail. She has completely shattered my confidence, that I don’t speak much anymore. We’ve been trying for a baby for over a year and she told me when she found out that he can’t afford to have a child because he needs her permission because he owes her money (he doesn’t owe her much). She then tried to convince me to break up with him and go out with my best friend. They have told me for some time the family does not celebrate birthdays, but recently for my partner’s 45th all her friends starting saying his mum was organising a dinner. He said my mother won’t decide for me who I spend my birthday with. I want to spend my day with you.. Next thing, a motorcyclist had bumped the side of her car, no one was injured but he said his mum was in a catatonic state. He then told her she could organise her dinner because she wanted to. We got there, and she had pulled out of her catatonic state pretty brilliantly, with balloons you’d see at 12 year olds party and her two closest friends. I couldn’t get a word in much at this dinner, but one of her friends said she was looking for a husband, and his mum said, darling you should marry her. It’s all caused me so much pain.

       "4101  Hi, I’m sixteen years old and a male. I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder since age 13. Also, I have used numerous drugs, alcohol, self-harmed, contemplated/attempted suicide twice, I don’t eat or treat myself very well, have critically low self esteem, etc. I’m living with my mother and older brother, they both express concern with me. I sleep too much, and have had to switch to online high school due to sleep issues. I used to do well in school, but now I have no motivation to do anything. I have things I enjoy doing, but I don’t enjoy them like I used to. My mother feels like she is an inconsistent parent, and I think that she tried to make up for it by punishing me harshly for every slip-up. It makes my quality of life much worse. I like the thought of suicide, although I don’t plan on it.

       "4020  The other morning, I woke up and took a shower, the next thing I remember is that I was driving on a busy highway approximately 60 miles from home, I immediately turned around and headed back. I have no recollection of why I left my house, I didnt have my cell phone, purse anything. The key I had to my vehicle was a spare key, not the usual one that I use in a key chain. I stopped at my daughter’s house (halfway between where I was when I “came to” and my house) panicked, scared, this has never happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "5155  I am curious about the amnesia part of DID. I seem to have different people who live inside me. Unlike what I know about DID, though, we all know about each other. We don’t always but occasionally we do talk to each other. I might comfort the child that is sad or the watchful one might tell me their impression of someone. We don’t forget what’s going on when one of the others is controlling the body. For instance, when I feel threatened or insulted a stronger person will stand in. I don’t disappear or anything I just seem to switch awareness into someone that has a different way of thinking, feeling, and behaving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3994  Hi I’m 19 years old, and in the last couple of years I’ve been having problems with my self esteem, my problem is that I’m too short (5’6) and sometimes when I go out and see very tall people i feel bad about myself because i’m too short and it affects my confidence. i go to the gym regularly, I’m studying filmmaking and most of the time I’m a happy person, I’ve never been bullied about my height and I don’t have any other problems, It’s just that i feel like i would feel better about myself if I were taller and I get sad every time I think this, and I think about it almost everyday, I just want a solution for my self esteem problem, and I want you to help me to cope with this, because i know I’ll be living a better life once i get past this problem.

       "573   My 10-year-old son has been repeatedly stealing. My husband and I have spoken about this with him several times. He always promises us that he will never ever do it again and that he has realised his mistake , but a couple weeks later he brings home something that is not his. He has so far been caught at a grocery store where he was forgiven, stole from me at home to buy few books. All our efforts have been futile. Today he bought home a couple of toys that he stole from his friends. We would like to take him to his teacher tomorrow and make him return the items, but fear that he will be socially scarred for life and worse, he may stoop in to do worse things for us exposing him to his freinds .. Please help. We are desperate parents and only want best for our child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "      <td>It’s impossible to give a diagnosis over the internet. The most common questions that I receive here at Psych Central are from people with anxiety disorders who fear that they may be developing schizophrenia. Anecdotally, it seems to be a very common fear, especially among people with anxiety.It makes sense that people with severe anxiety would believe that they might have schizophrenia. People with anxiety disorders often fear the worst-case scenario. In their minds, schizophrenia is the worst-case scenario. Among the lay public, it is the most frightening of all mental health disorders.Panic attacks are frightening. Panic attacks cause an extreme state of heightened distress. As you mentioned, it makes you feel like you’re on the “edges of insanity.” That’s how all people feel when they are experiencing panic attacks. Panic attacks are a sign of an anxiety disorder, not a psychotic disorder. Even though it may feel that way, it is not that way.The idea that you have yet to consult a mental health professional is likely contributing to this problem. I understand that you’re frightened of treatment but you have nothing to fear. Mental health professionals want to help you. Good, effective treatment is available.Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in the world. Highly effective treatments exist that can help you immediately, relieving your distressing symptoms. When you think about it, it’s nonsensical to suffer with a highly treatable condition. The sooner that you seek treatment, the sooner you will feel better.Nothing that you have written in your letter would indicate schizophrenia. You mentioned hypnagogic hallucinations before falling asleep. Those are a normal part of falling asleep but we often only remember them when we are having trouble falling asleep. If we have them, then immediately wake up, we remember them. If we have them and then fall asleep, we don’t remember them at all.If I could interview you, I would want to know why you are experiencing so much stress. What is causing you to feel this way? Stress has a cause. You are obviously worried about something. Did something recently change in your life? What are you worried about? It’s important to know what is causing these problems.Even if it’s difficult, make it a priority to consult a mental health professional. Once you have the initial meeting, you will likely quickly begin to feel better. You will see that it is not a frightening experience. Treatment can begin as soon as the first session. That means that you will likely leave your first session with less anxiety and a solid treatment plan for the future. You will be on your way to recovery.One of the best ways to reduce anxiety is to focus on reality. Staying grounded in reality is an important element in reducing panic and fear. Obviously, that is easier said than done which is why it’s important to consult a mental health professional. They will know how to help you. They have received explicit training to help with these types of problems. You should not wait another day. Make an appointment immediately. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.</td>\n",
       "      <td>I don’t even really know where to start. For the past 7 months I’ve been under extreme mounts of stress followed by a few panic attacks, that have left me so emotionally unstable that I feel that I’m teetering on edges of insanity. I’m in constant fear that I might be experience psychosis. I’ve been having hypnagogic hallucinations right before falling asleep that have left me in so much distress. Sometimes I’ll hear a loud sound or different voices that are loud. I’d like to not that I’ve experienced this for most of my life. But since having these panic attacks and just hours on the internet and reading about mental illness it has left me scared that it maybe something more. I’m extremely scared I might be in the beginning stages of schizophrenia. I’ve become hyperaware, I literally am always making sure that I’m not hearing things or seeing things. I just feel so lost and sad all the time I just want to feel whole again. Sorry if this seems a little jumpy I’m just in tears as I type this. I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety or any anxiety disorder and I fear it may be more than that anyway. I’ve become so afraid of my mind because if I have a weird thought I am constantly ruminating on it and it drives me up the wall. Couple of days ago I literally typed in the same question about schizophrenia 30 different times. I need help but I’m so afraid that the Doctor may confirm my fears. I just don’t know what to do. Is the hyperawareness of sounds, weird thoughts and hypnagogic hallucinations a sign that I’m becoming schizophrenic? I also have a cousin who is schizophrenic and I have an older father so I know I’m at higher risk. I’m in shambles over this. Anything would help. I don’t really know if any of this even makes but please help.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Congratulations on bringing your new baby into the world. Since you are in your 30s and you are concerned with attachment issues, I’m guessing that this was an all the more special event in your life.First, please take a look at the research on attachment outcomes for babies who are in daycare. They generally do as well or better than babies who are not. Babies in childcare do know who their mothers are. By six months, babies are secure in their attachment to their moms, especially when the moms do as you are doing while they are on leave — spending a lot of time and having a lot of contact with their children.What you can do to ease both of you into your eventual return to work is to gradually start spending some time apart. You may already be doing this. Put your baby down in a baby carrier or a comfortable made-for-baby cushion for short times during the day. Give him some experience with you putting him down and then coming back. Allow your friends to hold him and play with him at times so he gets used to interacting with other people besides you. Since you are breast feeding, start doing some pumping (and stock piling milk in the freezer) and introduce a bottle for a feeding or two when he is six months old to get him used to it. Talk to your pediatrician or a lactation specialist about how best to do this.It will be hard at first to leave him. You are part of an attachment couple after all. But do remind yourself that providing for him financially as well as emotionally is part of what will keep him safe and secure. If your work is part of what makes happy, he will also have a happier mom. To keep the emotional attachment going, all you need to do is establish a relaxed and attentive routine as you get ready in the morning, play with him between when you get home and bedtime, and enjoy your weekends together.I wish you well.</td>\n",
       "      <td>From a woman in the UK: Hi, I have a 4 month old baby boy and i have to go back to work when he’s 7 months. I understand that will be a key age for forming secure attachment and i won’t be around for some of every day. i can work from home but not all the time. I’m worried about disruption to our relationship and his attachment. We are breastfeeding, cosleeping and i wear him in a carrier often. He is settled and doing well with this arrangement but of course we will have some distance when I’m back at work. Is there anything i can do to make things easier for my baby? Thank you</td>\n",

       "      <td>Just by writing to us you have begun to make the right kind of changes. Whenever there are so many difficulties the psyche will often shut down from the pain. It is an attempt to protect itself — but whatever protects also inhibits. The nature of reactions from trauma center around the brain trying to remind and warn or avoid and forget what has happened. The limitations you are feeling sound like they are a direct result of all the loss and trauma you’ve experienced. While it isn’t something I could diagnose from your email there are conditions that can arise from this kind of ordeal that can have a debilitating effect. One of these can cause numbness and feelings of being detached, isolated or disconnected from other people or yourself. This symptom collection can be triggered by any number of events, but is known to occur as a result of sexual violence, profound loss or death, injury — or witnessing of these things. When something that can overwhelm us happens that includes these type of experiences it is classified as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.) In days gone by it was thought that only the kind of things very few people see would cause the disorder. Now, it is widely accepted that very common experiences, like a break-up with a boyfriend, can be enough to trigger similar symptoms. Here is more information about this.The descriptions below are not meant for you to diagnose yourself, but to understand more about what PTSD is, and how it can influence a person’s life. Here are some common symptoms of PTSD:It would be best to go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis. to help determine if you might benefit from seeking out professional help here is a brief online quiz. This can assure the treatment is properly matched with your symptoms.Finally, there are several approaches that have been successful with PTSD which fall into 3 general categories: Psychotherapy, medication, and self-help. The various forms of psychotherapy are:Often prescribed medications are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft), and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine (Effexor).Self-help recommendations supported by research are: exercise. acupuncture. Yoga, workbooks and social support. For an excellent discussion on these and other treatment option please read Margarita Tartakovsky’s article here.The important thing is that you are asking for help. This is an excellent start. I would go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis and while you are waiting to begin formal treatment you may want to take part in some of the self-help approaches.Wishing you patience and peace,</td>\n",
       "      <td>Hello! I would like to know some exercises or something I can practice to get myself out of this numb state of emotions. Last year was really hard for me (break up of a 4yr relationship, rape, loss of 2 good friends) and I was in constant pain and then I think it just switched somehow in me some kind of defense mechanism I think when I just stopped feeling at all. It was helpful and helped me a lot to sort out a lot of things. Now when it’s relatively a long time over and im supposed to get better I just cant. The bad thing is that i cannot express love or open myself to any bpdy because I just can’t feel what they feel… I imagine it as some kind of a barrier in me. Do you have any advice on how to get rid of it? It really bothers me because I’m a young person and I love life and my friends and I wanna fall in love sometimes etc. Thank you for listening :) (From Slovakia)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Incest involves sexual relationships between people who are related by blood. According to the laws in your state (and the laws in virtually every other state and most countries), incest is illegal. You’re committing a criminal act. It is a serious crime that is punishable by law.Your state forbids marriage and sexual relationships between people who are closely related by blood. When the two of you were younger, and depending upon your age difference, your older brother could have been charged with the crime of unlawful intercourse with a minor. Had he been found guilty, he would have been deemed a sex offender, possibly sent to prison and potentially put on a sex offender registry that would have significantly limited his freedom.In order to be successfully prosecuted for incest in the state in which you live, three elements would need to be present: 1) that you had sexual intercourse with a close blood relative; 2) that you knew about the blood relation at the time of the sexual act; and 3) the sex was consensual. Based on everything you’ve written in your letter, it’s possible that you could be prosecuted for your behavior.In terms of punishment, it could range from spending 16 months to two or three years in prison depending upon your prior criminal record, whether both parties were consenting adults, the degree of the blood relationship, and other mitigating factors. Because incest is considered a sex offense, if found guilty, you would have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life.The reason incest is outlawed is because of the serious birth defects that could result from inbreeding. In studies of children of incest, nearly half were born with severe birth defects, suffered early death or experienced mild mental impairments. That children are at a high risk of experiencing those types of problems is one reason why incestuous relationships are so morally indefensible.You said that you can’t stop engaging in this sexual behavior but it’s important to recognize that you are making a choice. No one is forcing you to have sex with your brother. You are consenting to this behavior. You are an equal participant. You are choosing to continue to engage in a sexual relationship with your brother for personal reasons. The idea that you have no choice in this matter is simply untrue. You have a choice.The good news is that you have control over your behavior. You can choose to not engage in this illegal act. Should you get caught, not only would you be facing potential incarceration, but you also risk being labeled a sex offender and being placed on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life. That outcome would be immensely detrimental to your life.To admit that you want to stop but can’t indicates that this problem may not be something you can resolve on your own. I highly recommend that you consult a therapist. A therapist will not judge you or turn you in to the authorities. You will not shock them. They will simply help you to resolve this problem. It is better to deal with this issue now, rather than continuing to risk getting into legal trouble or producing a child that has a nearly 50 percent chance of living a compromised life. Good luck and please take care.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Me and my older brother have always been close and he’s always been my hero. As for me, myself, I started the journey of getting couyselinf since I was when apparently, I would masterbate in school (in class, in the bathroom, and once even on the monkey bars). I also got in trouble once for peeing in front of my dad. So im sure this plays a part I why my mood has been so negative recently. And no, I was never molested. My parents are loving but always absent. this also plays a part in what is going on in my life. Given I was very sexual at a young age, I told my brother while crying frantically that I wanted to be his wife. 2 times I was the cause of him vbreakinbg woth someone he loved (guilt), and I wad responsible for insisting to let me see what sex feels like. I lost my virginity to him I n a triumphany victory because I though after we made love that he would be all mine, what a sick thought in reflection, although the most intense sex ive ever had. We are highly sexual with each other still. I even cater to his extreme foot fetish and bdsm although afterwards every time I feel so dirty and putrid. what a paradox, pain mixed with pleasure, so confusing. its to the point now where other guys don’t turn me on anymore. I only want to have sex with him and to make it worse, I get jealous when he even mentions other girls. How do I stop doing this?</td>\n",

You aren’t likely to be able to work on your own problems if you are constantly braced for what will happen next at home.You were able to find love and marry. It’s time you and your husband started your own adult lives. Getting away from the patterns that are long established in your mother’s home will free the two of you to learn how to be with each other in a healthy environment in a healthy way. If you chose your partner well, I think you may be surprised at how much your love will flourish.I assume that you are both working and that you can afford the apartment. If you can, I suggest that whatever it costs, you can’t afford not to move. I urge you to trust your own good judgment and get out of there. If you find that you can’t figure out how to make it happen, do consider seeing a therapist for a few sessions (both you and your husband) to get some support and some new ideas.You may well find that once you are out of the situation, your anxiety and depression will be considerably reduced.I wish you well.</td>\n",

       "2   It’s impossible to give a diagnosis over the internet. The most common questions that I receive here at Psych Central are from people with anxiety disorders who fear that they may be developing schizophrenia. Anecdotally, it seems to be a very common fear, especially among people with anxiety.It makes sense that people with severe anxiety would believe that they might have schizophrenia. People with anxiety disorders often fear the worst-case scenario. In their minds, schizophrenia is the worst-case scenario. Among the lay public, it is the most frightening of all mental health disorders.Panic attacks are frightening. Panic attacks cause an extreme state of heightened distress. As you mentioned, it makes you feel like you’re on the “edges of insanity.” That’s how all people feel when they are experiencing panic attacks. Panic attacks are a sign of an anxiety disorder, not a psychotic disorder. Even though it may feel that way, it is not that way.The idea that you have yet to consult a mental health professional is likely contributing to this problem. I understand that you’re frightened of treatment but you have nothing to fear. Mental health professionals want to help you. Good, effective treatment is available.Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in the world. Highly effective treatments exist that can help you immediately, relieving your distressing symptoms. When you think about it, it’s nonsensical to suffer with a highly treatable condition. The sooner that you seek treatment, the sooner you will feel better.Nothing that you have written in your letter would indicate schizophrenia. You mentioned hypnagogic hallucinations before falling asleep. Those are a normal part of falling asleep but we often only remember them when we are having trouble falling asleep. If we have them, then immediately wake up, we remember them. If we have them and then fall asleep, we don’t remember them at all.If I could interview you, I would want to know why you are experiencing so much stress. What is causing you to feel this way? Stress has a cause. You are obviously worried about something. Did something recently change in your life? What are you worried about? It’s important to know what is causing these problems.Even if it’s difficult, make it a priority to consult a mental health professional. Once you have the initial meeting, you will likely quickly begin to feel better. You will see that it is not a frightening experience. Treatment can begin as soon as the first session. That means that you will likely leave your first session with less anxiety and a solid treatment plan for the future. You will be on your way to recovery.One of the best ways to reduce anxiety is to focus on reality. Staying grounded in reality is an important element in reducing panic and fear. Obviously, that is easier said than done which is why it’s important to consult a mental health professional. They will know how to help you. They have received explicit training to help with these types of problems. You should not wait another day. Make an appointment immediately. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.                                                                                       \n",
       "3   Congratulations on bringing your new baby into the world. Since you are in your 30s and you are concerned with attachment issues, I’m guessing that this was an all the more special event in your life.First, please take a look at the research on attachment outcomes for babies who are in daycare. They generally do as well or better than babies who are not. Babies in childcare do know who their mothers are. By six months, babies are secure in their attachment to their moms, especially when the moms do as you are doing while they are on leave — spending a lot of time and having a lot of contact with their children.What you can do to ease both of you into your eventual return to work is to gradually start spending some time apart. You may already be doing this. Put your baby down in a baby carrier or a comfortable made-for-baby cushion for short times during the day. Give him some experience with you putting him down and then coming back. Allow your friends to hold him and play with him at times so he gets used to interacting with other people besides you. Since you are breast feeding, start doing some pumping (and stock piling milk in the freezer) and introduce a bottle for a feeding or two when he is six months old to get him used to it. Talk to your pediatrician or a lactation specialist about how best to do this.It will be hard at first to leave him. You are part of an attachment couple after all. But do remind yourself that providing for him financially as well as emotionally is part of what will keep him safe and secure. If your work is part of what makes happy, he will also have a happier mom. To keep the emotional attachment going, all you need to do is establish a relaxed and attentive routine as you get ready in the morning, play with him between when you get home and bedtime, and enjoy your weekends together.I wish you well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "10  Just by writing to us you have begun to make the right kind of changes. Whenever there are so many difficulties the psyche will often shut down from the pain. It is an attempt to protect itself — but whatever protects also inhibits. The nature of reactions from trauma center around the brain trying to remind and warn or avoid and forget what has happened. The limitations you are feeling sound like they are a direct result of all the loss and trauma you’ve experienced. While it isn’t something I could diagnose from your email there are conditions that can arise from this kind of ordeal that can have a debilitating effect. One of these can cause numbness and feelings of being detached, isolated or disconnected from other people or yourself. This symptom collection can be triggered by any number of events, but is known to occur as a result of sexual violence, profound loss or death, injury — or witnessing of these things. When something that can overwhelm us happens that includes these type of experiences it is classified as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.) In days gone by it was thought that only the kind of things very few people see would cause the disorder. Now, it is widely accepted that very common experiences, like a break-up with a boyfriend, can be enough to trigger similar symptoms. Here is more information about this.The descriptions below are not meant for you to diagnose yourself, but to understand more about what PTSD is, and how it can influence a person’s life. Here are some common symptoms of PTSD:It would be best to go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis. to help determine if you might benefit from seeking out professional help here is a brief online quiz. This can assure the treatment is properly matched with your symptoms.Finally, there are several approaches that have been successful with PTSD which fall into 3 general categories: Psychotherapy, medication, and self-help. The various forms of psychotherapy are:Often prescribed medications are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft), and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine (Effexor).Self-help recommendations supported by research are: exercise. acupuncture. Yoga, workbooks and social support. For an excellent discussion on these and other treatment option please read Margarita Tartakovsky’s article here.The important thing is that you are asking for help. This is an excellent start. I would go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis and while you are waiting to begin formal treatment you may want to take part in some of the self-help approaches.Wishing you patience and peace,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "14  Incest involves sexual relationships between people who are related by blood. According to the laws in your state (and the laws in virtually every other state and most countries), incest is illegal. You’re committing a criminal act. It is a serious crime that is punishable by law.Your state forbids marriage and sexual relationships between people who are closely related by blood. When the two of you were younger, and depending upon your age difference, your older brother could have been charged with the crime of unlawful intercourse with a minor. Had he been found guilty, he would have been deemed a sex offender, possibly sent to prison and potentially put on a sex offender registry that would have significantly limited his freedom.In order to be successfully prosecuted for incest in the state in which you live, three elements would need to be present: 1) that you had sexual intercourse with a close blood relative; 2) that you knew about the blood relation at the time of the sexual act; and 3) the sex was consensual. Based on everything you’ve written in your letter, it’s possible that you could be prosecuted for your behavior.In terms of punishment, it could range from spending 16 months to two or three years in prison depending upon your prior criminal record, whether both parties were consenting adults, the degree of the blood relationship, and other mitigating factors. Because incest is considered a sex offense, if found guilty, you would have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life.The reason incest is outlawed is because of the serious birth defects that could result from inbreeding. In studies of children of incest, nearly half were born with severe birth defects, suffered early death or experienced mild mental impairments. That children are at a high risk of experiencing those types of problems is one reason why incestuous relationships are so morally indefensible.You said that you can’t stop engaging in this sexual behavior but it’s important to recognize that you are making a choice. No one is forcing you to have sex with your brother. You are consenting to this behavior. You are an equal participant. You are choosing to continue to engage in a sexual relationship with your brother for personal reasons. The idea that you have no choice in this matter is simply untrue. You have a choice.The good news is that you have control over your behavior. You can choose to not engage in this illegal act. Should you get caught, not only would you be facing potential incarceration, but you also risk being labeled a sex offender and being placed on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life. That outcome would be immensely detrimental to your life.To admit that you want to stop but can’t indicates that this problem may not be something you can resolve on your own. I highly recommend that you consult a therapist. A therapist will not judge you or turn you in to the authorities. You will not shock them. They will simply help you to resolve this problem. It is better to deal with this issue now, rather than continuing to risk getting into legal trouble or producing a child that has a nearly 50 percent chance of living a compromised life. Good luck and please take care.   \n",
       "20  Thank you for writing. In my opinion, this is more than a good idea – it’s a great idea! You are 20. You’ve been dealing with this since you were only 13! You aren’t likely to be able to work on your own problems if you are constantly braced for what will happen next at home.You were able to find love and marry. It’s time you and your husband started your own adult lives. Getting away from the patterns that are long established in your mother’s home will free the two of you to learn how to be with each other in a healthy environment in a healthy way. If you chose your partner well, I think you may be surprised at how much your love will flourish.I assume that you are both working and that you can afford the apartment. If you can, I suggest that whatever it costs, you can’t afford not to move. I urge you to trust your own good judgment and get out of there. If you find that you can’t figure out how to make it happen, do consider seeing a therapist for a few sessions (both you and your husband) to get some support and some new ideas.You may well find that once you are out of the situation, your anxiety and depression will be considerably reduced.I wish you well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "2   I don’t even really know where to start. For the past 7 months I’ve been under extreme mounts of stress followed by a few panic attacks, that have left me so emotionally unstable that I feel that I’m teetering on edges of insanity. I’m in constant fear that I might be experience psychosis. I’ve been having hypnagogic hallucinations right before falling asleep that have left me in so much distress. Sometimes I’ll hear a loud sound or different voices that are loud. I’d like to not that I’ve experienced this for most of my life. But since having these panic attacks and just hours on the internet and reading about mental illness it has left me scared that it maybe something more. I’m extremely scared I might be in the beginning stages of schizophrenia. I’ve become hyperaware, I literally am always making sure that I’m not hearing things or seeing things. I just feel so lost and sad all the time I just want to feel whole again. Sorry if this seems a little jumpy I’m just in tears as I type this. I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety or any anxiety disorder and I fear it may be more than that anyway. I’ve become so afraid of my mind because if I have a weird thought I am constantly ruminating on it and it drives me up the wall. Couple of days ago I literally typed in the same question about schizophrenia 30 different times. I need help but I’m so afraid that the Doctor may confirm my fears. I just don’t know what to do. Is the hyperawareness of sounds, weird thoughts and hypnagogic hallucinations a sign that I’m becoming schizophrenic? I also have a cousin who is schizophrenic and I have an older father so I know I’m at higher risk. I’m in shambles over this. Anything would help. I don’t really know if any of this even makes but please help.   \n",

He is settled and doing well with this arrangement but of course we will have some distance when I’m back at work. Is there anything i can do to make things easier for my baby? Thank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "10  Hello! I would like to know some exercises or something I can practice to get myself out of this numb state of emotions. Last year was really hard for me (break up of a 4yr relationship, rape, loss of 2 good friends) and I was in constant pain and then I think it just switched somehow in me some kind of defense mechanism I think when I just stopped feeling at all. It was helpful and helped me a lot to sort out a lot of things. Now when it’s relatively a long time over and im supposed to get better I just cant. The bad thing is that i cannot express love or open myself to any bpdy because I just can’t feel what they feel… I imagine it as some kind of a barrier in me. Do you have any advice on how to get rid of it? It really bothers me because I’m a young person and I love life and my friends and I wanna fall in love sometimes etc. Thank you for listening :) (From Slovakia)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "14  Me and my older brother have always been close and he’s always been my hero. As for me, myself, I started the journey of getting couyselinf since I was when apparently, I would masterbate in school (in class, in the bathroom, and once even on the monkey bars). I also got in trouble once for peeing in front of my dad. So im sure this plays a part I why my mood has been so negative recently. And no, I was never molested. My parents are loving but always absent. this also plays a part in what is going on in my life. Given I was very sexual at a young age, I told my brother while crying frantically that I wanted to be his wife. 2 times I was the cause of him vbreakinbg woth someone he loved (guilt), and I wad responsible for insisting to let me see what sex feels like. I lost my virginity to him I n a triumphany victory because I though after we made love that he would be all mine, what a sick thought in reflection, although the most intense sex ive ever had. We are highly sexual with each other still. I even cater to his extreme foot fetish and bdsm although afterwards every time I feel so dirty and putrid. what a paradox, pain mixed with pleasure, so confusing. its to the point now where other guys don’t turn me on anymore. I only want to have sex with him and to make it worse, I get jealous when he even mentions other girls. How do I stop doing this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "      <td>It’s impossible to give a diagnosis over the internet. The most common questions that I receive here at Psych Central are from people with anxiety disorders who fear that they may be developing schizophrenia. Anecdotally, it seems to be a very common fear, especially among people with anxiety.It makes sense that people with severe anxiety would believe that they might have schizophrenia. People with anxiety disorders often fear the worst-case scenario. In their minds, schizophrenia is the worst-case scenario. Among the lay public, it is the most frightening of all mental health disorders.Panic attacks are frightening. Panic attacks cause an extreme state of heightened distress. As you mentioned, it makes you feel like you’re on the “edges of insanity.” That’s how all people feel when they are experiencing panic attacks. Panic attacks are a sign of an anxiety disorder, not a psychotic disorder. Even though it may feel that way, it is not that way.The idea that you have yet to consult a mental health professional is likely contributing to this problem. I understand that you’re frightened of treatment but you have nothing to fear. Mental health professionals want to help you. Good, effective treatment is available.Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in the world. Highly effective treatments exist that can help you immediately, relieving your distressing symptoms. When you think about it, it’s nonsensical to suffer with a highly treatable condition. The sooner that you seek treatment, the sooner you will feel better.Nothing that you have written in your letter would indicate schizophrenia. You mentioned hypnagogic hallucinations before falling asleep. Those are a normal part of falling asleep but we often only remember them when we are having trouble falling asleep. If we have them, then immediately wake up, we remember them. If we have them and then fall asleep, we don’t remember them at all.If I could interview you, I would want to know why you are experiencing so much stress. What is causing you to feel this way? Stress has a cause. You are obviously worried about something. Did something recently change in your life? What are you worried about? It’s important to know what is causing these problems.Even if it’s difficult, make it a priority to consult a mental health professional. Once you have the initial meeting, you will likely quickly begin to feel better. You will see that it is not a frightening experience. Treatment can begin as soon as the first session. That means that you will likely leave your first session with less anxiety and a solid treatment plan for the future. You will be on your way to recovery.One of the best ways to reduce anxiety is to focus on reality. Staying grounded in reality is an important element in reducing panic and fear. Obviously, that is easier said than done which is why it’s important to consult a mental health professional. They will know how to help you. They have received explicit training to help with these types of problems. You should not wait another day. Make an appointment immediately. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.</td>\n",
       "      <td>I don’t even really know where to start. For the past 7 months I’ve been under extreme mounts of stress followed by a few panic attacks, that have left me so emotionally unstable that I feel that I’m teetering on edges of insanity. I’m in constant fear that I might be experience psychosis. I’ve been having hypnagogic hallucinations right before falling asleep that have left me in so much distress. Sometimes I’ll hear a loud sound or different voices that are loud. I’d like to not that I’ve experienced this for most of my life. But since having these panic attacks and just hours on the internet and reading about mental illness it has left me scared that it maybe something more. I’m extremely scared I might be in the beginning stages of schizophrenia. I’ve become hyperaware, I literally am always making sure that I’m not hearing things or seeing things. I just feel so lost and sad all the time I just want to feel whole again. Sorry if this seems a little jumpy I’m just in tears as I type this. I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety or any anxiety disorder and I fear it may be more than that anyway. I’ve become so afraid of my mind because if I have a weird thought I am constantly ruminating on it and it drives me up the wall. Couple of days ago I literally typed in the same question about schizophrenia 30 different times. I need help but I’m so afraid that the Doctor may confirm my fears. I just don’t know what to do. Is the hyperawareness of sounds, weird thoughts and hypnagogic hallucinations a sign that I’m becoming schizophrenic? I also have a cousin who is schizophrenic and I have an older father so I know I’m at higher risk. I’m in shambles over this. Anything would help. I don’t really know if any of this even makes but please help.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Congratulations on bringing your new baby into the world. Since you are in your 30s and you are concerned with attachment issues, I’m guessing that this was an all the more special event in your life.First, please take a look at the research on attachment outcomes for babies who are in daycare. They generally do as well or better than babies who are not. Babies in childcare do know who their mothers are. By six months, babies are secure in their attachment to their moms, especially when the moms do as you are doing while they are on leave — spending a lot of time and having a lot of contact with their children.What you can do to ease both of you into your eventual return to work is to gradually start spending some time apart. You may already be doing this. Put your baby down in a baby carrier or a comfortable made-for-baby cushion for short times during the day. Give him some experience with you putting him down and then coming back. Allow your friends to hold him and play with him at times so he gets used to interacting with other people besides you. Since you are breast feeding, start doing some pumping (and stock piling milk in the freezer) and introduce a bottle for a feeding or two when he is six months old to get him used to it. Talk to your pediatrician or a lactation specialist about how best to do this.It will be hard at first to leave him. You are part of an attachment couple after all. But do remind yourself that providing for him financially as well as emotionally is part of what will keep him safe and secure. If your work is part of what makes happy, he will also have a happier mom. To keep the emotional attachment going, all you need to do is establish a relaxed and attentive routine as you get ready in the morning, play with him between when you get home and bedtime, and enjoy your weekends together.I wish you well.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Just by writing to us you have begun to make the right kind of changes. Whenever there are so many difficulties the psyche will often shut down from the pain. It is an attempt to protect itself — but whatever protects also inhibits. The nature of reactions from trauma center around the brain trying to remind and warn or avoid and forget what has happened. The limitations you are feeling sound like they are a direct result of all the loss and trauma you’ve experienced. While it isn’t something I could diagnose from your email there are conditions that can arise from this kind of ordeal that can have a debilitating effect. One of these can cause numbness and feelings of being detached, isolated or disconnected from other people or yourself. This symptom collection can be triggered by any number of events, but is known to occur as a result of sexual violence, profound loss or death, injury — or witnessing of these things. When something that can overwhelm us happens that includes these type of experiences it is classified as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.) In days gone by it was thought that only the kind of things very few people see would cause the disorder. Now, it is widely accepted that very common experiences, like a break-up with a boyfriend, can be enough to trigger similar symptoms. Here is more information about this.The descriptions below are not meant for you to diagnose yourself, but to understand more about what PTSD is, and how it can influence a person’s life. Here are some common symptoms of PTSD:It would be best to go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis. to help determine if you might benefit from seeking out professional help here is a brief online quiz. This can assure the treatment is properly matched with your symptoms.Finally, there are several approaches that have been successful with PTSD which fall into 3 general categories: Psychotherapy, medication, and self-help. The various forms of psychotherapy are:Often prescribed medications are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft), and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine (Effexor).Self-help recommendations supported by research are: exercise. acupuncture. Yoga, workbooks and social support. For an excellent discussion on these and other treatment option please read Margarita Tartakovsky’s article here.The important thing is that you are asking for help. This is an excellent start. I would go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis and while you are waiting to begin formal treatment you may want to take part in some of the self-help approaches.Wishing you patience and peace,</td>\n",
       "      <td>Hello! I would like to know some exercises or something I can practice to get myself out of this numb state of emotions. Last year was really hard for me (break up of a 4yr relationship, rape, loss of 2 good friends) and I was in constant pain and then I think it just switched somehow in me some kind of defense mechanism I think when I just stopped feeling at all. It was helpful and helped me a lot to sort out a lot of things. Now when it’s relatively a long time over and im supposed to get better I just cant. The bad thing is that i cannot express love or open myself to any bpdy because I just can’t feel what they feel… I imagine it as some kind of a barrier in me. Do you have any advice on how to get rid of it? It really bothers me because I’m a young person and I love life and my friends and I wanna fall in love sometimes etc. Thank you for listening :) (From Slovakia)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Incest involves sexual relationships between people who are related by blood. According to the laws in your state (and the laws in virtually every other state and most countries), incest is illegal. You’re committing a criminal act. It is a serious crime that is punishable by law.Your state forbids marriage and sexual relationships between people who are closely related by blood. When the two of you were younger, and depending upon your age difference, your older brother could have been charged with the crime of unlawful intercourse with a minor. Had he been found guilty, he would have been deemed a sex offender, possibly sent to prison and potentially put on a sex offender registry that would have significantly limited his freedom.In order to be successfully prosecuted for incest in the state in which you live, three elements would need to be present: 1) that you had sexual intercourse with a close blood relative; 2) that you knew about the blood relation at the time of the sexual act; and 3) the sex was consensual. Based on everything you’ve written in your letter, it’s possible that you could be prosecuted for your behavior.In terms of punishment, it could range from spending 16 months to two or three years in prison depending upon your prior criminal record, whether both parties were consenting adults, the degree of the blood relationship, and other mitigating factors. Because incest is considered a sex offense, if found guilty, you would have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life.The reason incest is outlawed is because of the serious birth defects that could result from inbreeding. In studies of children of incest, nearly half were born with severe birth defects, suffered early death or experienced mild mental impairments. That children are at a high risk of experiencing those types of problems is one reason why incestuous relationships are so morally indefensible.You said that you can’t stop engaging in this sexual behavior but it’s important to recognize that you are making a choice. No one is forcing you to have sex with your brother. You are consenting to this behavior. You are an equal participant. You are choosing to continue to engage in a sexual relationship with your brother for personal reasons. The idea that you have no choice in this matter is simply untrue. You have a choice.The good news is that you have control over your behavior. You can choose to not engage in this illegal act. Should you get caught, not only would you be facing potential incarceration, but you also risk being labeled a sex offender and being placed on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life. That outcome would be immensely detrimental to your life.To admit that you want to stop but can’t indicates that this problem may not be something you can resolve on your own. I highly recommend that you consult a therapist. A therapist will not judge you or turn you in to the authorities. You will not shock them. They will simply help you to resolve this problem. It is better to deal with this issue now, rather than continuing to risk getting into legal trouble or producing a child that has a nearly 50 percent chance of living a compromised life. Good luck and please take care.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Me and my older brother have always been close and he’s always been my hero. As for me, myself, I started the journey of getting couyselinf since I was when apparently, I would masterbate in school (in class, in the bathroom, and once even on the monkey bars). I also got in trouble once for peeing in front of my dad. So im sure this plays a part I why my mood has been so negative recently. And no, I was never molested. My parents are loving but always absent. this also plays a part in what is going on in my life. Given I was very sexual at a young age, I told my brother while crying frantically that I wanted to be his wife. 2 times I was the cause of him vbreakinbg woth someone he loved (guilt), and I wad responsible for insisting to let me see what sex feels like. I lost my virginity to him I n a triumphany victory because I though after we made love that he would be all mine, what a sick thought in reflection, although the most intense sex ive ever had. We are highly sexual with each other still. I even cater to his extreme foot fetish and bdsm although afterwards every time I feel so dirty and putrid. what a paradox, pain mixed with pleasure, so confusing. its to the point now where other guys don’t turn me on anymore. I only want to have sex with him and to make it worse, I get jealous when he even mentions other girls. How do I stop doing this?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thank you for writing. In my opinion, this is more than a good idea – it’s a great idea! You are 20. You’ve been dealing with this since you were only 13! You aren’t likely to be able to work on your own problems if you are constantly braced for what will happen next at home.You were able to find love and marry. It’s time you and your husband started your own adult lives. Getting away from the patterns that are long established in your mother’s home will free the two of you to learn how to be with each other in a healthy environment in a healthy way. If you chose your partner well, I think you may be surprised at how much your love will flourish.I assume that you are both working and that you can afford the apartment. If you can, I suggest that whatever it costs, you can’t afford not to move. I urge you to trust your own good judgment and get out of there. If you find that you can’t figure out how to make it happen, do consider seeing a therapist for a few sessions (both you and your husband) to get some support and some new ideas.You may well find that once you are out of the situation, your anxiety and depression will be considerably reduced.I wish you well.</td>\n",

       "0  It’s impossible to give a diagnosis over the internet. The most common questions that I receive here at Psych Central are from people with anxiety disorders who fear that they may be developing schizophrenia. Anecdotally, it seems to be a very common fear, especially among people with anxiety.It makes sense that people with severe anxiety would believe that they might have schizophrenia. People with anxiety disorders often fear the worst-case scenario. In their minds, schizophrenia is the worst-case scenario. Among the lay public, it is the most frightening of all mental health disorders.Panic attacks are frightening. Panic attacks cause an extreme state of heightened distress. As you mentioned, it makes you feel like you’re on the “edges of insanity.” That’s how all people feel when they are experiencing panic attacks. Panic attacks are a sign of an anxiety disorder, not a psychotic disorder. Even though it may feel that way, it is not that way.The idea that you have yet to consult a mental health professional is likely contributing to this problem. I understand that you’re frightened of treatment but you have nothing to fear. Mental health professionals want to help you. Good, effective treatment is available.Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in the world. Highly effective treatments exist that can help you immediately, relieving your distressing symptoms. When you think about it, it’s nonsensical to suffer with a highly treatable condition. The sooner that you seek treatment, the sooner you will feel better.Nothing that you have written in your letter would indicate schizophrenia. You mentioned hypnagogic hallucinations before falling asleep. Those are a normal part of falling asleep but we often only remember them when we are having trouble falling asleep. If we have them, then immediately wake up, we remember them. If we have them and then fall asleep, we don’t remember them at all.If I could interview you, I would want to know why you are experiencing so much stress. What is causing you to feel this way? Stress has a cause. You are obviously worried about something. Did something recently change in your life? What are you worried about? It’s important to know what is causing these problems.Even if it’s difficult, make it a priority to consult a mental health professional. Once you have the initial meeting, you will likely quickly begin to feel better. You will see that it is not a frightening experience. Treatment can begin as soon as the first session. That means that you will likely leave your first session with less anxiety and a solid treatment plan for the future. You will be on your way to recovery.One of the best ways to reduce anxiety is to focus on reality. Staying grounded in reality is an important element in reducing panic and fear. Obviously, that is easier said than done which is why it’s important to consult a mental health professional. They will know how to help you. They have received explicit training to help with these types of problems. You should not wait another day. Make an appointment immediately. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.                                                                                       \n",
       "1  Congratulations on bringing your new baby into the world. Since you are in your 30s and you are concerned with attachment issues, I’m guessing that this was an all the more special event in your life.First, please take a look at the research on attachment outcomes for babies who are in daycare. They generally do as well or better than babies who are not. Babies in childcare do know who their mothers are. By six months, babies are secure in their attachment to their moms, especially when the moms do as you are doing while they are on leave — spending a lot of time and having a lot of contact with their children.What you can do to ease both of you into your eventual return to work is to gradually start spending some time apart. You may already be doing this. Put your baby down in a baby carrier or a comfortable made-for-baby cushion for short times during the day. Give him some experience with you putting him down and then coming back. Allow your friends to hold him and play with him at times so he gets used to interacting with other people besides you. Since you are breast feeding, start doing some pumping (and stock piling milk in the freezer) and introduce a bottle for a feeding or two when he is six months old to get him used to it. Talk to your pediatrician or a lactation specialist about how best to do this.It will be hard at first to leave him. You are part of an attachment couple after all. But do remind yourself that providing for him financially as well as emotionally is part of what will keep him safe and secure. If your work is part of what makes happy, he will also have a happier mom. To keep the emotional attachment going, all you need to do is establish a relaxed and attentive routine as you get ready in the morning, play with him between when you get home and bedtime, and enjoy your weekends together.I wish you well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "2  Just by writing to us you have begun to make the right kind of changes. Whenever there are so many difficulties the psyche will often shut down from the pain. It is an attempt to protect itself — but whatever protects also inhibits. The nature of reactions from trauma center around the brain trying to remind and warn or avoid and forget what has happened. The limitations you are feeling sound like they are a direct result of all the loss and trauma you’ve experienced. While it isn’t something I could diagnose from your email there are conditions that can arise from this kind of ordeal that can have a debilitating effect. One of these can cause numbness and feelings of being detached, isolated or disconnected from other people or yourself. This symptom collection can be triggered by any number of events, but is known to occur as a result of sexual violence, profound loss or death, injury — or witnessing of these things. When something that can overwhelm us happens that includes these type of experiences it is classified as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.) In days gone by it was thought that only the kind of things very few people see would cause the disorder. Now, it is widely accepted that very common experiences, like a break-up with a boyfriend, can be enough to trigger similar symptoms. Here is more information about this.The descriptions below are not meant for you to diagnose yourself, but to understand more about what PTSD is, and how it can influence a person’s life. Here are some common symptoms of PTSD:It would be best to go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis. to help determine if you might benefit from seeking out professional help here is a brief online quiz. This can assure the treatment is properly matched with your symptoms.Finally, there are several approaches that have been successful with PTSD which fall into 3 general categories: Psychotherapy, medication, and self-help. The various forms of psychotherapy are:Often prescribed medications are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft), and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine (Effexor).Self-help recommendations supported by research are: exercise. acupuncture. Yoga, workbooks and social support. For an excellent discussion on these and other treatment option please read Margarita Tartakovsky’s article here.The important thing is that you are asking for help. This is an excellent start. I would go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis and while you are waiting to begin formal treatment you may want to take part in some of the self-help approaches.Wishing you patience and peace,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3  Incest involves sexual relationships between people who are related by blood. According to the laws in your state (and the laws in virtually every other state and most countries), incest is illegal. You’re committing a criminal act. It is a serious crime that is punishable by law.Your state forbids marriage and sexual relationships between people who are closely related by blood. When the two of you were younger, and depending upon your age difference, your older brother could have been charged with the crime of unlawful intercourse with a minor. Had he been found guilty, he would have been deemed a sex offender, possibly sent to prison and potentially put on a sex offender registry that would have significantly limited his freedom.In order to be successfully prosecuted for incest in the state in which you live, three elements would need to be present: 1) that you had sexual intercourse with a close blood relative; 2) that you knew about the blood relation at the time of the sexual act; and 3) the sex was consensual. Based on everything you’ve written in your letter, it’s possible that you could be prosecuted for your behavior.In terms of punishment, it could range from spending 16 months to two or three years in prison depending upon your prior criminal record, whether both parties were consenting adults, the degree of the blood relationship, and other mitigating factors. Because incest is considered a sex offense, if found guilty, you would have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life.The reason incest is outlawed is because of the serious birth defects that could result from inbreeding. In studies of children of incest, nearly half were born with severe birth defects, suffered early death or experienced mild mental impairments. That children are at a high risk of experiencing those types of problems is one reason why incestuous relationships are so morally indefensible.You said that you can’t stop engaging in this sexual behavior but it’s important to recognize that you are making a choice. No one is forcing you to have sex with your brother. You are consenting to this behavior. You are an equal participant. You are choosing to continue to engage in a sexual relationship with your brother for personal reasons. The idea that you have no choice in this matter is simply untrue. You have a choice.The good news is that you have control over your behavior. You can choose to not engage in this illegal act. Should you get caught, not only would you be facing potential incarceration, but you also risk being labeled a sex offender and being placed on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life. That outcome would be immensely detrimental to your life.To admit that you want to stop but can’t indicates that this problem may not be something you can resolve on your own. I highly recommend that you consult a therapist. A therapist will not judge you or turn you in to the authorities. You will not shock them. They will simply help you to resolve this problem. It is better to deal with this issue now, rather than continuing to risk getting into legal trouble or producing a child that has a nearly 50 percent chance of living a compromised life. Good luck and please take care.   \n",
       "4  Thank you for writing. In my opinion, this is more than a good idea – it’s a great idea! You are 20. You’ve been dealing with this since you were only 13! You aren’t likely to be able to work on your own problems if you are constantly braced for what will happen next at home.You were able to find love and marry. It’s time you and your husband started your own adult lives. Getting away from the patterns that are long established in your mother’s home will free the two of you to learn how to be with each other in a healthy environment in a healthy way. If you chose your partner well, I think you may be surprised at how much your love will flourish.I assume that you are both working and that you can afford the apartment. If you can, I suggest that whatever it costs, you can’t afford not to move. I urge you to trust your own good judgment and get out of there. If you find that you can’t figure out how to make it happen, do consider seeing a therapist for a few sessions (both you and your husband) to get some support and some new ideas.You may well find that once you are out of the situation, your anxiety and depression will be considerably reduced.I wish you well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "0  I don’t even really know where to start. For the past 7 months I’ve been under extreme mounts of stress followed by a few panic attacks, that have left me so emotionally unstable that I feel that I’m teetering on edges of insanity. I’m in constant fear that I might be experience psychosis. I’ve been having hypnagogic hallucinations right before falling asleep that have left me in so much distress. Sometimes I’ll hear a loud sound or different voices that are loud. I’d like to not that I’ve experienced this for most of my life. But since having these panic attacks and just hours on the internet and reading about mental illness it has left me scared that it maybe something more. I’m extremely scared I might be in the beginning stages of schizophrenia. I’ve become hyperaware, I literally am always making sure that I’m not hearing things or seeing things. I just feel so lost and sad all the time I just want to feel whole again. Sorry if this seems a little jumpy I’m just in tears as I type this. I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety or any anxiety disorder and I fear it may be more than that anyway. I’ve become so afraid of my mind because if I have a weird thought I am constantly ruminating on it and it drives me up the wall. Couple of days ago I literally typed in the same question about schizophrenia 30 different times. I need help but I’m so afraid that the Doctor may confirm my fears. I just don’t know what to do. Is the hyperawareness of sounds, weird thoughts and hypnagogic hallucinations a sign that I’m becoming schizophrenic? I also have a cousin who is schizophrenic and I have an older father so I know I’m at higher risk. I’m in shambles over this. Anything would help. I don’t really know if any of this even makes but please help.   \n",
       "1  From a woman in the UK: Hi, I have a 4 month old baby boy and i have to go back to work when he’s 7 months. I understand that will be a key age for forming secure attachment and i won’t be around for some of every day. i can work from home but not all the time. I’m worried about disruption to our relationship and his attachment. We are breastfeeding, cosleeping and i wear him in a carrier often. He is settled and doing well with this arrangement but of course we will have some distance when I’m back at work. Is there anything i can do to make things easier for my baby? Thank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2  Hello! I would like to know some exercises or something I can practice to get myself out of this numb state of emotions. Last year was really hard for me (break up of a 4yr relationship, rape, loss of 2 good friends) and I was in constant pain and then I think it just switched somehow in me some kind of defense mechanism I think when I just stopped feeling at all. It was helpful and helped me a lot to sort out a lot of things. Now when it’s relatively a long time over and im supposed to get better I just cant. The bad thing is that i cannot express love or open myself to any bpdy because I just can’t feel what they feel… I imagine it as some kind of a barrier in me. Do you have any advice on how to get rid of it? It really bothers me because I’m a young person and I love life and my friends and I wanna fall in love sometimes etc. Thank you for listening :) (From Slovakia)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "3  Me and my older brother have always been close and he’s always been my hero. As for me, myself, I started the journey of getting couyselinf since I was when apparently, I would masterbate in school (in class, in the bathroom, and once even on the monkey bars). I also got in trouble once for peeing in front of my dad. So im sure this plays a part I why my mood has been so negative recently. And no, I was never molested. My parents are loving but always absent. this also plays a part in what is going on in my life. Given I was very sexual at a young age, I told my brother while crying frantically that I wanted to be his wife. 2 times I was the cause of him vbreakinbg woth someone he loved (guilt), and I wad responsible for insisting to let me see what sex feels like. I lost my virginity to him I n a triumphany victory because I though after we made love that he would be all mine, what a sick thought in reflection, although the most intense sex ive ever had. We are highly sexual with each other still. I even cater to his extreme foot fetish and bdsm although afterwards every time I feel so dirty and putrid. what a paradox, pain mixed with pleasure, so confusing. its to the point now where other guys don’t turn me on anymore. I only want to have sex with him and to make it worse, I get jealous when he even mentions other girls. How do I stop doing this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

The most common questions that I receive here at Psych Central are from people with anxiety disorders who fear that they may be developing schizophrenia. Anecdotally, it seems to be a very common fear, especially among people with anxiety.It makes sense that people with severe anxiety would believe that they might have schizophrenia. People with anxiety disorders often fear the worst-case scenario. In their minds, schizophrenia is the worst-case scenario. Among the lay public, it is the most frightening of all mental health disorders.Panic attacks are frightening. Panic attacks cause an extreme state of heightened distress. As you mentioned, it makes you feel like you’re on the “edges of insanity.” That’s how all people feel when they are experiencing panic attacks. Panic attacks are a sign of an anxiety disorder, not a psychotic disorder. Even though it may feel that way, it is not that way.The idea that you have yet to consult a mental health professional is likely contributing to this problem. I understand that you’re frightened of treatment but you have nothing to fear. Mental health professionals want to help you. Good, effective treatment is available.Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in the world. Highly effective treatments exist that can help you immediately, relieving your distressing symptoms. When you think about it, it’s nonsensical to suffer with a highly treatable condition. The sooner that you seek treatment, the sooner you will feel better.Nothing that you have written in your letter would indicate schizophrenia. You mentioned hypnagogic hallucinations before falling asleep. Those are a normal part of falling asleep but we often only remember them when we are having trouble falling asleep. If we have them, then immediately wake up, we remember them. If we have them and then fall asleep, we don’t remember them at all.If I could interview you, I would want to know why you are experiencing so much stress. What is causing you to feel this way? Stress has a cause. You are obviously worried about something. Did something recently change in your life? What are you worried about? It’s important to know what is causing these problems.Even if it’s difficult, make it a priority to consult a mental health professional. Once you have the initial meeting, you will likely quickly begin to feel better. You will see that it is not a frightening experience. Treatment can begin as soon as the first session. That means that you will likely leave your first session with less anxiety and a solid treatment plan for the future. You will be on your way to recovery.One of the best ways to reduce anxiety is to focus on reality. Staying grounded in reality is an important element in reducing panic and fear. Obviously, that is easier said than done which is why it’s important to consult a mental health professional. They will know how to help you. They have received explicit training to help with these types of problems. You should not wait another day. Make an appointment immediately. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.</td>\n",
       "      <td>I don’t even really know where to start. For the past 7 months I’ve been under extreme mounts of stress followed by a few panic attacks, that have left me so emotionally unstable that I feel that I’m teetering on edges of insanity. I’m in constant fear that I might be experience psychosis. I’ve been having hypnagogic hallucinations right before falling asleep that have left me in so much distress. Sometimes I’ll hear a loud sound or different voices that are loud. I’d like to not that I’ve experienced this for most of my life. But since having these panic attacks and just hours on the internet and reading about mental illness it has left me scared that it maybe something more. I’m extremely scared I might be in the beginning stages of schizophrenia. I’ve become hyperaware, I literally am always making sure that I’m not hearing things or seeing things. I just feel so lost and sad all the time I just want to feel whole again. Sorry if this seems a little jumpy I’m just in tears as I type this. I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety or any anxiety disorder and I fear it may be more than that anyway. I’ve become so afraid of my mind because if I have a weird thought I am constantly ruminating on it and it drives me up the wall. Couple of days ago I literally typed in the same question about schizophrenia 30 different times. I need help but I’m so afraid that the Doctor may confirm my fears. I just don’t know what to do. Is the hyperawareness of sounds, weird thoughts and hypnagogic hallucinations a sign that I’m becoming schizophrenic? I also have a cousin who is schizophrenic and I have an older father so I know I’m at higher risk. I’m in shambles over this. Anything would help. I don’t really know if any of this even makes but please help.</td>\n",

Since you are in your 30s and you are concerned with attachment issues, I’m guessing that this was an all the more special event in your life.First, please take a look at the research on attachment outcomes for babies who are in daycare. They generally do as well or better than babies who are not. Babies in childcare do know who their mothers are. By six months, babies are secure in their attachment to their moms, especially when the moms do as you are doing while they are on leave — spending a lot of time and having a lot of contact with their children.What you can do to ease both of you into your eventual return to work is to gradually start spending some time apart. You may already be doing this. Put your baby down in a baby carrier or a comfortable made-for-baby cushion for short times during the day. Give him some experience with you putting him down and then coming back. Allow your friends to hold him and play with him at times so he gets used to interacting with other people besides you. Since you are breast feeding, start doing some pumping (and stock piling milk in the freezer) and introduce a bottle for a feeding or two when he is six months old to get him used to it. Talk to your pediatrician or a lactation specialist about how best to do this.It will be hard at first to leave him. You are part of an attachment couple after all. But do remind yourself that providing for him financially as well as emotionally is part of what will keep him safe and secure. If your work is part of what makes happy, he will also have a happier mom. To keep the emotional attachment going, all you need to do is establish a relaxed and attentive routine as you get ready in the morning, play with him between when you get home and bedtime, and enjoy your weekends together.I wish you well.</td>\n",
       "      <td>From a woman in the UK: Hi, I have a 4 month old baby boy and i have to go back to work when he’s 7 months. I understand that will be a key age for forming secure attachment and i won’t be around for some of every day. i can work from home but not all the time. I’m worried about disruption to our relationship and his attachment. We are breastfeeding, cosleeping and i wear him in a carrier often. He is settled and doing well with this arrangement but of course we will have some distance when I’m back at work. Is there anything i can do to make things easier for my baby? Thank you</td>\n",

       "      <td>Just by writing to us you have begun to make the right kind of changes. Whenever there are so many difficulties the psyche will often shut down from the pain. It is an attempt to protect itself — but whatever protects also inhibits. The nature of reactions from trauma center around the brain trying to remind and warn or avoid and forget what has happened. The limitations you are feeling sound like they are a direct result of all the loss and trauma you’ve experienced. While it isn’t something I could diagnose from your email there are conditions that can arise from this kind of ordeal that can have a debilitating effect. One of these can cause numbness and feelings of being detached, isolated or disconnected from other people or yourself. This symptom collection can be triggered by any number of events, but is known to occur as a result of sexual violence, profound loss or death, injury — or witnessing of these things. When something that can overwhelm us happens that includes these type of experiences it is classified as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.) In days gone by it was thought that only the kind of things very few people see would cause the disorder. Now, it is widely accepted that very common experiences, like a break-up with a boyfriend, can be enough to trigger similar symptoms. Here is more information about this.The descriptions below are not meant for you to diagnose yourself, but to understand more about what PTSD is, and how it can influence a person’s life. Here are some common symptoms of PTSD:It would be best to go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis. to help determine if you might benefit from seeking out professional help here is a brief online quiz. This can assure the treatment is properly matched with your symptoms.Finally, there are several approaches that have been successful with PTSD which fall into 3 general categories: Psychotherapy, medication, and self-help. The various forms of psychotherapy are:Often prescribed medications are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft), and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine (Effexor).Self-help recommendations supported by research are: exercise. acupuncture. Yoga, workbooks and social support. For an excellent discussion on these and other treatment option please read Margarita Tartakovsky’s article here.The important thing is that you are asking for help. This is an excellent start. I would go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis and while you are waiting to begin formal treatment you may want to take part in some of the self-help approaches.Wishing you patience and peace,</td>\n",
       "      <td>Hello! I would like to know some exercises or something I can practice to get myself out of this numb state of emotions. Last year was really hard for me (break up of a 4yr relationship, rape, loss of 2 good friends) and I was in constant pain and then I think it just switched somehow in me some kind of defense mechanism I think when I just stopped feeling at all. It was helpful and helped me a lot to sort out a lot of things. Now when it’s relatively a long time over and im supposed to get better I just cant. The bad thing is that i cannot express love or open myself to any bpdy because I just can’t feel what they feel… I imagine it as some kind of a barrier in me. Do you have any advice on how to get rid of it? It really bothers me because I’m a young person and I love life and my friends and I wanna fall in love sometimes etc. Thank you for listening :) (From Slovakia)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Incest involves sexual relationships between people who are related by blood. According to the laws in your state (and the laws in virtually every other state and most countries), incest is illegal. You’re committing a criminal act. It is a serious crime that is punishable by law.Your state forbids marriage and sexual relationships between people who are closely related by blood. When the two of you were younger, and depending upon your age difference, your older brother could have been charged with the crime of unlawful intercourse with a minor. Had he been found guilty, he would have been deemed a sex offender, possibly sent to prison and potentially put on a sex offender registry that would have significantly limited his freedom.In order to be successfully prosecuted for incest in the state in which you live, three elements would need to be present: 1) that you had sexual intercourse with a close blood relative; 2) that you knew about the blood relation at the time of the sexual act; and 3) the sex was consensual. Based on everything you’ve written in your letter, it’s possible that you could be prosecuted for your behavior.In terms of punishment, it could range from spending 16 months to two or three years in prison depending upon your prior criminal record, whether both parties were consenting adults, the degree of the blood relationship, and other mitigating factors. Because incest is considered a sex offense, if found guilty, you would have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life.The reason incest is outlawed is because of the serious birth defects that could result from inbreeding. In studies of children of incest, nearly half were born with severe birth defects, suffered early death or experienced mild mental impairments. That children are at a high risk of experiencing those types of problems is one reason why incestuous relationships are so morally indefensible.You said that you can’t stop engaging in this sexual behavior but it’s important to recognize that you are making a choice. No one is forcing you to have sex with your brother. You are consenting to this behavior. You are an equal participant. You are choosing to continue to engage in a sexual relationship with your brother for personal reasons. The idea that you have no choice in this matter is simply untrue. You have a choice.The good news is that you have control over your behavior. You can choose to not engage in this illegal act. Should you get caught, not only would you be facing potential incarceration, but you also risk being labeled a sex offender and being placed on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life. That outcome would be immensely detrimental to your life.To admit that you want to stop but can’t indicates that this problem may not be something you can resolve on your own. I highly recommend that you consult a therapist. A therapist will not judge you or turn you in to the authorities. You will not shock them. They will simply help you to resolve this problem. It is better to deal with this issue now, rather than continuing to risk getting into legal trouble or producing a child that has a nearly 50 percent chance of living a compromised life. Good luck and please take care.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Me and my older brother have always been close and he’s always been my hero. As for me, myself, I started the journey of getting couyselinf since I was when apparently, I would masterbate in school (in class, in the bathroom, and once even on the monkey bars). I also got in trouble once for peeing in front of my dad. So im sure this plays a part I why my mood has been so negative recently. And no, I was never molested. My parents are loving but always absent. this also plays a part in what is going on in my life. Given I was very sexual at a young age, I told my brother while crying frantically that I wanted to be his wife. 2 times I was the cause of him vbreakinbg woth someone he loved (guilt), and I wad responsible for insisting to let me see what sex feels like. I lost my virginity to him I n a triumphany victory because I though after we made love that he would be all mine, what a sick thought in reflection, although the most intense sex ive ever had. We are highly sexual with each other still. I even cater to his extreme foot fetish and bdsm although afterwards every time I feel so dirty and putrid. what a paradox, pain mixed with pleasure, so confusing. its to the point now where other guys don’t turn me on anymore. I only want to have sex with him and to make it worse, I get jealous when he even mentions other girls. How do I stop doing this?</td>\n",

You aren’t likely to be able to work on your own problems if you are constantly braced for what will happen next at home.You were able to find love and marry. It’s time you and your husband started your own adult lives. Getting away from the patterns that are long established in your mother’s home will free the two of you to learn how to be with each other in a healthy environment in a healthy way. If you chose your partner well, I think you may be surprised at how much your love will flourish.I assume that you are both working and that you can afford the apartment. If you can, I suggest that whatever it costs, you can’t afford not to move. I urge you to trust your own good judgment and get out of there. If you find that you can’t figure out how to make it happen, do consider seeing a therapist for a few sessions (both you and your husband) to get some support and some new ideas.You may well find that once you are out of the situation, your anxiety and depression will be considerably reduced.I wish you well.</td>\n",

       "0  It’s impossible to give a diagnosis over the internet. The most common questions that I receive here at Psych Central are from people with anxiety disorders who fear that they may be developing schizophrenia. Anecdotally, it seems to be a very common fear, especially among people with anxiety.It makes sense that people with severe anxiety would believe that they might have schizophrenia. People with anxiety disorders often fear the worst-case scenario. In their minds, schizophrenia is the worst-case scenario. Among the lay public, it is the most frightening of all mental health disorders.Panic attacks are frightening. Panic attacks cause an extreme state of heightened distress. As you mentioned, it makes you feel like you’re on the “edges of insanity.” That’s how all people feel when they are experiencing panic attacks. Panic attacks are a sign of an anxiety disorder, not a psychotic disorder. Even though it may feel that way, it is not that way.The idea that you have yet to consult a mental health professional is likely contributing to this problem. I understand that you’re frightened of treatment but you have nothing to fear. Mental health professionals want to help you. Good, effective treatment is available.Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in the world. Highly effective treatments exist that can help you immediately, relieving your distressing symptoms. When you think about it, it’s nonsensical to suffer with a highly treatable condition. The sooner that you seek treatment, the sooner you will feel better.Nothing that you have written in your letter would indicate schizophrenia. You mentioned hypnagogic hallucinations before falling asleep. Those are a normal part of falling asleep but we often only remember them when we are having trouble falling asleep. If we have them, then immediately wake up, we remember them. If we have them and then fall asleep, we don’t remember them at all.If I could interview you, I would want to know why you are experiencing so much stress. What is causing you to feel this way? Stress has a cause. You are obviously worried about something. Did something recently change in your life? What are you worried about? It’s important to know what is causing these problems.Even if it’s difficult, make it a priority to consult a mental health professional. Once you have the initial meeting, you will likely quickly begin to feel better. You will see that it is not a frightening experience. Treatment can begin as soon as the first session. That means that you will likely leave your first session with less anxiety and a solid treatment plan for the future. You will be on your way to recovery.One of the best ways to reduce anxiety is to focus on reality. Staying grounded in reality is an important element in reducing panic and fear. Obviously, that is easier said than done which is why it’s important to consult a mental health professional. They will know how to help you. They have received explicit training to help with these types of problems. You should not wait another day. Make an appointment immediately. I wish you the best of luck. Please take care.                                                                                       \n",
       "1  Congratulations on bringing your new baby into the world. Since you are in your 30s and you are concerned with attachment issues, I’m guessing that this was an all the more special event in your life.First, please take a look at the research on attachment outcomes for babies who are in daycare. They generally do as well or better than babies who are not. Babies in childcare do know who their mothers are. By six months, babies are secure in their attachment to their moms, especially when the moms do as you are doing while they are on leave — spending a lot of time and having a lot of contact with their children.What you can do to ease both of you into your eventual return to work is to gradually start spending some time apart. You may already be doing this. Put your baby down in a baby carrier or a comfortable made-for-baby cushion for short times during the day. Give him some experience with you putting him down and then coming back. Allow your friends to hold him and play with him at times so he gets used to interacting with other people besides you. Since you are breast feeding, start doing some pumping (and stock piling milk in the freezer) and introduce a bottle for a feeding or two when he is six months old to get him used to it. Talk to your pediatrician or a lactation specialist about how best to do this.It will be hard at first to leave him. You are part of an attachment couple after all. But do remind yourself that providing for him financially as well as emotionally is part of what will keep him safe and secure. If your work is part of what makes happy, he will also have a happier mom. To keep the emotional attachment going, all you need to do is establish a relaxed and attentive routine as you get ready in the morning, play with him between when you get home and bedtime, and enjoy your weekends together.I wish you well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "2  Just by writing to us you have begun to make the right kind of changes. Whenever there are so many difficulties the psyche will often shut down from the pain. It is an attempt to protect itself — but whatever protects also inhibits. The nature of reactions from trauma center around the brain trying to remind and warn or avoid and forget what has happened. The limitations you are feeling sound like they are a direct result of all the loss and trauma you’ve experienced. While it isn’t something I could diagnose from your email there are conditions that can arise from this kind of ordeal that can have a debilitating effect. One of these can cause numbness and feelings of being detached, isolated or disconnected from other people or yourself. This symptom collection can be triggered by any number of events, but is known to occur as a result of sexual violence, profound loss or death, injury — or witnessing of these things. When something that can overwhelm us happens that includes these type of experiences it is classified as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD.) In days gone by it was thought that only the kind of things very few people see would cause the disorder. Now, it is widely accepted that very common experiences, like a break-up with a boyfriend, can be enough to trigger similar symptoms. Here is more information about this.The descriptions below are not meant for you to diagnose yourself, but to understand more about what PTSD is, and how it can influence a person’s life. Here are some common symptoms of PTSD:It would be best to go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis. to help determine if you might benefit from seeking out professional help here is a brief online quiz. This can assure the treatment is properly matched with your symptoms.Finally, there are several approaches that have been successful with PTSD which fall into 3 general categories: Psychotherapy, medication, and self-help. The various forms of psychotherapy are:Often prescribed medications are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft), and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine (Effexor).Self-help recommendations supported by research are: exercise. acupuncture. Yoga, workbooks and social support. For an excellent discussion on these and other treatment option please read Margarita Tartakovsky’s article here.The important thing is that you are asking for help. This is an excellent start. I would go to a mental health professional to get an accurate diagnosis and while you are waiting to begin formal treatment you may want to take part in some of the self-help approaches.Wishing you patience and peace,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3  Incest involves sexual relationships between people who are related by blood. According to the laws in your state (and the laws in virtually every other state and most countries), incest is illegal. You’re committing a criminal act. It is a serious crime that is punishable by law.Your state forbids marriage and sexual relationships between people who are closely related by blood. When the two of you were younger, and depending upon your age difference, your older brother could have been charged with the crime of unlawful intercourse with a minor. Had he been found guilty, he would have been deemed a sex offender, possibly sent to prison and potentially put on a sex offender registry that would have significantly limited his freedom.In order to be successfully prosecuted for incest in the state in which you live, three elements would need to be present: 1) that you had sexual intercourse with a close blood relative; 2) that you knew about the blood relation at the time of the sexual act; and 3) the sex was consensual. Based on everything you’ve written in your letter, it’s possible that you could be prosecuted for your behavior.In terms of punishment, it could range from spending 16 months to two or three years in prison depending upon your prior criminal record, whether both parties were consenting adults, the degree of the blood relationship, and other mitigating factors. Because incest is considered a sex offense, if found guilty, you would have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life.The reason incest is outlawed is because of the serious birth defects that could result from inbreeding. In studies of children of incest, nearly half were born with severe birth defects, suffered early death or experienced mild mental impairments. That children are at a high risk of experiencing those types of problems is one reason why incestuous relationships are so morally indefensible.You said that you can’t stop engaging in this sexual behavior but it’s important to recognize that you are making a choice. No one is forcing you to have sex with your brother. You are consenting to this behavior. You are an equal participant. You are choosing to continue to engage in a sexual relationship with your brother for personal reasons. The idea that you have no choice in this matter is simply untrue. You have a choice.The good news is that you have control over your behavior. You can choose to not engage in this illegal act. Should you get caught, not only would you be facing potential incarceration, but you also risk being labeled a sex offender and being placed on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life. That outcome would be immensely detrimental to your life.To admit that you want to stop but can’t indicates that this problem may not be something you can resolve on your own. I highly recommend that you consult a therapist. A therapist will not judge you or turn you in to the authorities. You will not shock them. They will simply help you to resolve this problem. It is better to deal with this issue now, rather than continuing to risk getting into legal trouble or producing a child that has a nearly 50 percent chance of living a compromised life. Good luck and please take care.   \n",
       "4  Thank you for writing. In my opinion, this is more than a good idea – it’s a great idea! You are 20. You’ve been dealing with this since you were only 13! You aren’t likely to be able to work on your own problems if you are constantly braced for what will happen next at home.You were able to find love and marry. It’s time you and your husband started your own adult lives. Getting away from the patterns that are long established in your mother’s home will free the two of you to learn how to be with each other in a healthy environment in a healthy way. If you chose your partner well, I think you may be surprised at how much your love will flourish.I assume that you are both working and that you can afford the apartment. If you can, I suggest that whatever it costs, you can’t afford not to move. I urge you to trust your own good judgment and get out of there. If you find that you can’t figure out how to make it happen, do consider seeing a therapist for a few sessions (both you and your husband) to get some support and some new ideas.You may well find that once you are out of the situation, your anxiety and depression will be considerably reduced.I wish you well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "0  I don’t even really know where to start. For the past 7 months I’ve been under extreme mounts of stress followed by a few panic attacks, that have left me so emotionally unstable that I feel that I’m teetering on edges of insanity. I’m in constant fear that I might be experience psychosis. I’ve been having hypnagogic hallucinations right before falling asleep that have left me in so much distress. Sometimes I’ll hear a loud sound or different voices that are loud. I’d like to not that I’ve experienced this for most of my life. But since having these panic attacks and just hours on the internet and reading about mental illness it has left me scared that it maybe something more. I’m extremely scared I might be in the beginning stages of schizophrenia. I’ve become hyperaware, I literally am always making sure that I’m not hearing things or seeing things. I just feel so lost and sad all the time I just want to feel whole again. Sorry if this seems a little jumpy I’m just in tears as I type this. I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety or any anxiety disorder and I fear it may be more than that anyway. I’ve become so afraid of my mind because if I have a weird thought I am constantly ruminating on it and it drives me up the wall. Couple of days ago I literally typed in the same question about schizophrenia 30 different times. I need help but I’m so afraid that the Doctor may confirm my fears. I just don’t know what to do. Is the hyperawareness of sounds, weird thoughts and hypnagogic hallucinations a sign that I’m becoming schizophrenic? I also have a cousin who is schizophrenic and I have an older father so I know I’m at higher risk. I’m in shambles over this. Anything would help. I don’t really know if any of this even makes but please help.   \n",
       "1  From a woman in the UK: Hi, I have a 4 month old baby boy and i have to go back to work when he’s 7 months. I understand that will be a key age for forming secure attachment and i won’t be around for some of every day. i can work from home but not all the time. I’m worried about disruption to our relationship and his attachment. We are breastfeeding, cosleeping and i wear him in a carrier often. He is settled and doing well with this arrangement but of course we will have some distance when I’m back at work. Is there anything i can do to make things easier for my baby? Thank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2  Hello! I would like to know some exercises or something I can practice to get myself out of this numb state of emotions. Last year was really hard for me (break up of a 4yr relationship, rape, loss of 2 good friends) and I was in constant pain and then I think it just switched somehow in me some kind of defense mechanism I think when I just stopped feeling at all. It was helpful and helped me a lot to sort out a lot of things. Now when it’s relatively a long time over and im supposed to get better I just cant. The bad thing is that i cannot express love or open myself to any bpdy because I just can’t feel what they feel… I imagine it as some kind of a barrier in me. Do you have any advice on how to get rid of it? It really bothers me because I’m a young person and I love life and my friends and I wanna fall in love sometimes etc. Thank you for listening :) (From Slovakia)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "3  Me and my older brother have always been close and he’s always been my hero. As for me, myself, I started the journey of getting couyselinf since I was when apparently, I would masterbate in school (in class, in the bathroom, and once even on the monkey bars). I also got in trouble once for peeing in front of my dad. So im sure this plays a part I why my mood has been so negative recently. And no, I was never molested. My parents are loving but always absent. this also plays a part in what is going on in my life. Given I was very sexual at a young age, I told my brother while crying frantically that I wanted to be his wife. 2 times I was the cause of him vbreakinbg woth someone he loved (guilt), and I wad responsible for insisting to let me see what sex feels like. I lost my virginity to him I n a triumphany victory because I though after we made love that he would be all mine, what a sick thought in reflection, although the most intense sex ive ever had. We are highly sexual with each other still. I even cater to his extreme foot fetish and bdsm although afterwards every time I feel so dirty and putrid. what a paradox, pain mixed with pleasure, so confusing. its to the point now where other guys don’t turn me on anymore. I only want to have sex with him and to make it worse, I get jealous when he even mentions other girls. How do I stop doing this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
